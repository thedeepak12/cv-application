# CV Application

This project is a dynamic, form-based CV/Resume builder application. It features a clean user interface where users can create professional resumes by filling out forms for personal information, education, experience, projects, and skills.

## Features

- **Multi-Section Form Builder**: Users can input personal information, education history, work experience, projects, and technical skills through intuitive forms.
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation ensures essential information (name and email) is provided.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular React components for each form section (GeneralInfo, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills).
- **Professional Styling**: Black and white design with clear typography hierarchy using different font weights for visual organization.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface and managing application state.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for modern web development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Modern JavaScript features for state management and component logic.

## What I Learned

- **React Hooks**: Utilized `useState` for managing complex form state across multiple components and sections.
- **Component Composition**: Built reusable form components (GeneralInfoForm, EducationForm, ExperienceForm, ProjectsForm, SkillsForm) that can be easily maintained and extended.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented dynamic UI that switches between edit and preview modes based on user interaction.
- **Form State Management**: Managed nested state objects for different CV sections while maintaining clean data flow.
- **Professional Typography**: Created clear visual hierarchy using font weights and sizes rather than colors for a clean, professional appearance.
- **Modern Build Tools**: Used Vite for fast development and optimized production builds with hot module replacement.
- **User Experience Design**: Focused on intuitive form flow and clear visual feedback for form validation and preview functionality.
